### Example 1
```{r}
#| fig-alt: "A stacked histogram of penguin body masses per species  where Gentoo has the highest average body mass (in grams) over Adelie and Chinstrap species, by x percent/x grams."
#| warning: false
#| message: false
#| echo: false


library(ggplot2)
library(palmerpenguins)

ggplot(data = penguins, aes(x = body_mass_g, fill = species)) +
  geom_histogram(alpha = 0.5, 
                 position = "identity") +
  scale_fill_manual(values = c("darkorange","purple","cyan4")) +
  labs(x = "Body mass (g)",
       y = "Frequency",
       title = "Penguin body masses")
```


### Example 2

![](nyt_viz){fig-alt="A dot plot of monthly global temperatures compared to the 20th-century average, where monthly global temperatures are increasing over time. Nearly every month since the mid-1970s is warmer than the 20th-century average, with 12 record-breaking hot months occurring between 2015-2023."}


### Example 3
